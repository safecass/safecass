===== g2log =====

On MAC:
    - g2log/src/crashhandler_unix.cpp: MAC => include <sys/ucontext.h> instead of <ucontext.h>
    - g2log/CMakeLists.txt: comment out "set(PLATFORM_LINK_LIBRIES rt)"

CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS needs to include "-std=c++11" option which is not supported by cisst and thus
conflicts with cisstCommon as follows:

    /Users/MJ/project/fault/cisst/cisstCommon/cmnTypeTraits.h:421:12: error: 'isnan' was not declared in this scope

    According to http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/isnan,
    #include <cmath> would resolve this problem but there should be a way to recognize
    c++11 support or not.  For this, refer to http://pageant.ghulbus.eu/?p=664
