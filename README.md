**SAFECASS** (**S**afety **A**rchitecture **f**or **E**ngineering
**C**omputer-**A**ssisted **S**urgical **S**ystems) is an open source framework
that enables reuse of experience and knowledge on safety, thereby facilitating
the development process of safety features for robot systems that physically
interact with humans.

*SAFECASS is currently undergoing major code restructuring to improve the
overall build process with better support for unit-testing.*  

For the time being, the master branch is not fully functional and only a
limited set of features is available.  The design documents are still
accessible via the [SAFECASS wiki](https://github.com/safecass/safecass/wiki).

The first release (Release 0.1.0) is scheduled by the end of October, 2015, and
is going to be a minimally functional version.

NEWS:
 * 10/21/2015: Travis CI build passes.
 * 10/19/2015: The build chain of SAFECASS is currently being re-written to
 make the overall build process simpler, easier, and cleaner.  This would also
 enable better handling of external dependency packages.
 * 10/11/2015: A set of wiki pages have been updated to reflect the latest
   design of SAFECASS.  Please click 
 * 09/21/2015: SAFECASS is currently undergoing repository transition.
