**SAFECASS** (**S**afety **A**rchitecture **f**or **E**ngineering
**C**omputer-**A**ssisted **S**urgical **S**ystems) is an open source framework
that enables reuse of experience and knowledge on safety, thereby facilitating
the development process of safety features for robot systems that physically
interact with humans.

SAFECASS is designed and developed as part of <a href='https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwGcEiVvK4n9RUJmSXhUYW90SG8' target='_blank'>my PhD thesis</a>, which focuses on the safety of component-based medical and surgical robot systems.  Relevant publications are available [here](https://github.com/safecass/safecass/wiki/Publications).

*SAFECASS is currently undergoing major code restructuring to improve the
overall build process with better support for unit-testing.*  

For the time being, the master branch is not fully functional and only a
limited set of features is available.  The design documents are still
accessible via the [SAFECASS wiki](https://github.com/safecass/safecass/wiki).
