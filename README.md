**SAFECASS** (**S**afety **A**rchitecture **f**or **E**ngineering
**C**omputer-**A**ssisted **S**urgical **S**ystems) is an open source framework
that enables reuse of experience and knowledge on safety, thereby facilitating
the development process of safety features for robot systems that physically
interact with humans.

*SAFECASS is currently undergoing major code restructuring to improve the
overall build process with better support for unit-testing.*  

For the time being, the master branch is not fully functional and only a
limited set of features is available.  The design documents are still
accessible via the [SAFECASS wiki](https://github.com/safecass/safecass/wiki).

The first release (Release 0.1.0) is scheduled by the end of October, 2015, and
is going to be a minimally functional version.
