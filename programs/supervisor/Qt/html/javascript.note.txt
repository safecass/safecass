Associative arrays in JS:
    http://www.steinbit.org/words/programming/associative-arrays-in-javascript

Creating an associative array and filling it with some data:

var container = {};
container["someKey"] = 3;
container["someOtherKey"] = someObject;
container["anotherKey"] = "Some text";
 
// ... or equivalently
var container = {
      someKey: 3,
                 someOtherKey: someObject,
                   anotherKey: "Some text"
};
Accessing elements in the associative array:

var someValue = container["someKey"];
container["otherKey"] = someValue;
 
// ... or equivalently
var someValue = container.someKey;
container.otherKey = someValue;
Iterating through all the elements in the associative array:

for (var key in container) {
       // hasOwnProperty() checks that attribute is from non-inherited prototype
       if (container.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
                 var element = container[key];
                    }
}
Deleting a key in the associative array:

delete container["someKey"];
 
// ... or equivalently
delete container.someKey;
 
// Notice: Don't assign null to the deleted key as
// this will re-create the key!
Checking if a key exists in the associative array:

if (container["someKey"] === undefined) {
       // Key does not exist
}
 
// ... or equivalently
if (container.someKey === undefined) {
       // Key does not exist
}
